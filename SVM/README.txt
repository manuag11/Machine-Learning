The src folder contains five Matlab scripts - 
1. hw1FindEigenDigits.m - This is the function file from the first homework
2. scripthw4.m - This script uses image pixels as training features to train SVM
3. script_hw4_with_pca.m - This script uses image pixels followed by PCA to train SVM
4. script_hw4_HOG.m - This script uses HOG features to train SVM
5. script_hw4_box_constraints.m - This is just a sample script to show how I vaired the box constraints paramters

To run any of the scripts, simply type <script-name> on the Matlab command line interface. Alternatively, you can also use the Run button provided by Matlab. 
Please note that the script script_hw4_HOG.m requires the Computer Vision System Toolbox from Matlab to run properly.
